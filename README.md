Delayed medical care is a common frustration across Canada, with minor injuries or conditions often going unchecked because navigating clinics, referrals, and waiting rooms takes too long. Patients have symptoms but lack an easy way to communicate them, while doctors spend hours triaging cases that could have been clarified upfront. We were inspired to streamline this process with ScanAhead, where users can describe their symptoms and upload 3D scans, connecting them to the right doctor faster and give clarity on care without the delays.

Patient Side
Users create an account and submit a case form describing their condition, both visually and verbally through 3D scanning affected areas, recording a voice memo, and specifying a preferred appointment or provider.

Doctor Side
Doctors log in to see cases submitted to them, with a neat form displaying each patient's clinical report and an AI summary of the overall information provided. Doctors can review the case in advance, come prepared for check-ups, and provide a more detailed and evaluated prognosis that helps patients determine their next steps.
